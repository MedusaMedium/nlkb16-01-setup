# NLOFIN 16 Keyboard (NLKB16-01) 

## Setup 

Guide for setting up the [NLOFIN 16 key board](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0CP5F4L34/ref=ask_ql_qh_dp_hza?th=1). There is a [tutorial video](https://www.amazon.com/live/video/033bca2cf6094248931d3cd3ea1196d6?ref_=dp_vse_lbvc_0) available from the seller with a google drive link (https://drive.google.com/file/d/1cni3t80pGqwBu0qUHREs2xyrqaKKHyLu/view).

The drive has a zip containing a few files, but the only important one for using [VIA](https://usevia.app/) is the [layout JSON file](./NLKB16_LAYOUT.json). The tutorial video describes how to change the keys and layouts, so feel free to switch over to that now that you have the layout file.
